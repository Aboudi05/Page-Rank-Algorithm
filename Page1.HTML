ERROR TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF LOUISIANA

<p><I>Mr. James C. Walker</I> filed a brief for plaintiff in error.</p>
<p><I>Mr. Alexander Porter Morse</I> for defendant in error. <I>Mr. M.J. Cunningham,</I> Attorney General of the State of Louisiana, and <I>Mr. Lional Adams</I> were on his brief.</p>

<p>MR. JUSTICE BROWN, after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>
<p>This case turns upon the constitutionality of an act of the General Assembly of the State of Louisiana, passed in 1890, providing for separate railway carriages for the white and colored races. Acts 1890, No. 111, p. 152.</p>
<p>The first section of the statute enacts "that all railway companies carrying passengers in their coaches in this State, shall provide equal but separate accommodations for the white, and colored races, by providing two or more passenger coaches for each passenger train, or by dividing the passenger coaches by a partition so as to secure separate accommodations: <I>Provided,</I> That this section shall not be construed to apply to street railroads. No person or persons, shall be admitted to occupy seats in coaches, other than, the ones, assigned, to them on account of the race they belong to."</p>
<p>By the second section it was enacted "that the officers of such passenger trains shall have power and are hereby required to assign each passenger to the coach or compartment used for the race to which such passenger belongs; any passenger insisting on going into a coach or compartment to which by race he does not belong, shall be liable to a fine of twenty-five dollars, or in lieu thereof to imprisonment for a period of not more than twenty days in the parish prison, and any officer of any railroad insisting on assigning a passenger to a coach or compartment other than the one set aside for the race to which said passenger belongs, shall be liable to a fine of twenty-five dollars, or in lieu thereof to imprisonment for a period of not more than twenty days in the parish prison; and should any passenger refuse to occupy the coach or compartment to which he or she is assigned by the officer of such railway, said officer shall have power to refuse to carry such passenger on his train, and for such refusal neither he nor the railway company which he represents shall be liable for damages in any of the courts of this State."</p>
<p>The third section provides penalties for the refusal or neglect of the officers, directors, conductors and employ√©s of railway companies to comply with the act, with a proviso that "nothing in this act shall be construed as applying to nurses attending children of the other race." The fourth section is immaterial.</p>
