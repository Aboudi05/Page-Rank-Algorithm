JOSE LUIS VAELLO MADERO.</h3></center>
<center>No. 20-303.</center>
<center><p><b>Supreme Court of the United States.</b></p></center>

<center>Argued November 9, 2021.</center>
<center>Decided April 21, 2022.</center>

<p>ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT.</p>


<p>The Territory Clause of the United States Constitution—which states that Congress may "make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory . . . belonging to the United States," Art. IV, § 3, cl. 2— affords Congress broad authority to legislate with respect to the U. S. Territories. In exercising that authority, Congress has long maintained different federal tax and benefits programs for residents of the Territories than for residents of the 50 States. For example, residents of Puerto Rico are typically exempt from most federal income, gift, estate, and excise taxes. See 48 U. S. C. § 734; see, <I>e.g.,</I> 26 U. S. C. §§ 933, 2209, 4081-4084. But just as not every federal tax extends to residents of Puerto Rico, so too not every federal benefits program extends to residents of Puerto Rico. One such benefits program is Supplemental Security Income (SSI), which by statute applies only to residents of the 50 States and the District of Columbia. 42 U. S. C. § 1382c(a)(1)(B)(i). The question presented is whether the equal-protection component of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause requires Congress to make Supplemental Security Income benefits available to residents of Puerto Rico to the same extent that Congress makes those benefits available to residents of the States.</p>
<p>Here, respondent Jose Luis Vaello Madero received SSI benefits while he was a resident of New York. He then moved to Puerto Rico, where he was no longer eligible to receive those benefits. Unaware of Vaello Madero's new residence, the Government continued to pay him SSI benefits. The Government eventually sued Vaello Madero to recover those errant payments, which totaled more than $28,000. In response, Vaello Madero invoked the Constitution, arguing that Congress's exclusion of residents of Puerto Rico from the SSI program violated the equal-protection component of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. The District Court and the Court of Appeals agreed.</p>
<p><I>Held</I>: The Constitution does not require Congress to extend SSI benefits to residents of Puerto Rico. In  <I>Califano</I> v. <I>Torres,</I> 435 U. S. 1, and <I>Harris</I> v. <I>Rosario,</I> 446 U. S. 651,</a> the Court applied the deferential rational-basis test to uphold Congress's decision not to extend certain federal benefits to Puerto Rico, noting that because Congress chose to treat residents of Puerto Rico differently from residents of the States for purposes of tax laws, it could do the same for benefits programs. Those two precedents dictate the result here. Congress's decision to exempt Puerto Rico's residents from most federal income, gift, estate, and excise taxes supplies a rational basis for likewise distinguishing residents of Puerto Rico from residents of the States for purposes of the SSI benefits program. Vaello Madero's contrary position would usher in potentially far-reaching consequences, with serious implications for the Puerto Rican people and the Puerto Rican economy. The Constitution does not require that extreme outcome. Pp. 4-6.</p>
<p>956 F. 3d 12, reversed.</p>
<p>KAVANAUGH, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which ROBERTS, C. J., and THOMAS, BREYER, ALITO, KAGAN, GORSUCH, and BARRETT, JJ., joined. THOMAS, J., and GORSUCH, J., filed concurring opinions. SOTOMAYOR, J., filed a dissenting opinion.</p>
<p>Justice KAVANAUGH, delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p>The United States includes five Territories: American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, the U. S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. This case involves Puerto Rico, which became a U. S. Territory in 1898 in the wake of the Spanish-American War.</p>
<p>For various historical and policy reasons, including local autonomy, Congress has not required residents of Puerto Rico to pay most federal income, gift, estate, and excise taxes. Congress has likewise not extended certain federal benefits programs to residents of Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>The question presented is whether the equal-protection component of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause requires Congress to make Supplemental Security Income benefits available to residents of Puerto Rico to the same extent that Congress makes those benefits available to residents of the States. In light of the text of the Constitution, longstanding historical practice, and this Court's precedents, the answer is no.</p>
<p><H2>* * *</H2></p>
<p>The Territory Clause of the Constitution states that Congress may "make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory . . . belonging to the United States." Art. IV, § 3, cl. 2. The text of the Clause affords Congress broad authority to legislate with respect to the U. S. Territories.</p>
<p>Exercising that authority, Congress sometimes legislates differently with respect to the Territories, including Puerto Rico, than it does with respect to the States. That longstanding congressional practice reflects both national and local considerations. In tackling the many facets of territorial governance, Congress must make numerous policy judgments that account not only for the needs of the United States as a whole but also for (among other things) the unique histories, economic conditions, social circumstances, independent policy views, and relative autonomy of the individual Territories.</p>
<p>Of relevance here, Congress must decide how to structure federal taxes and benefits for residents of the Territories. In doing so, Congress has long maintained federal tax and benefits programs for residents of Puerto Rico and the other Territories that differ in some respects from the federal tax and benefits programs for residents of the 50 States.</p>
<p>On the tax side, for example, residents of Puerto Rico are typically exempt from most federal income, gift, estate, and excise taxes. See 39 Stat. 954, as amended, 48 U. S. C. § 734; see, <I>e.g.,</I> 26 U. S. C. §§ 933, 2209, 4081-4084. At the same time, residents of Puerto Rico generally pay Social Security, Medicare, and unemployment taxes. 26 U. S. C. §§ 3121(e), 3306(j).</p>
<p>On the benefits side, residents of Puerto Rico are eligible for Social Security and Medicare. § 3121(e); 42 U. S. C. §§ 410(h)-(i), 1301(a)(1). Residents of Puerto Rico are also eligible for federal unemployment benefits. 26 U. S. C. § 3306(j); see also House Committee on Ways and Means, Green Book: Background Material and Data on the Programs Within the Jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means, App. A (24th ed. 2018).</p>
<p>But just as not every federal tax extends to residents of Puerto Rico, so too not every federal benefits program extends to residents of Puerto Rico. One example is the Supplemental Security Income program, which Congress passed and President Nixon signed into law in 1972. 86 Stat. 1465. The Supplemental Security Income program provides benefits for, among others, those who are age 65 or older and cannot financially support themselves.</p>
<p>To be eligible for Supplemental Security Income, an individual must be a "resident of the United States," 42 U. S. C. § 1382c(a)(1)(B)(i), which the statute defines as the 50 States and the District of Columbia, § 1382c(e). A later statute included residents of the Northern Mariana Islands in the program. Note following 48 U. S. C. § 1801; 90 Stat. 268. But residents of Puerto Rico are not eligible for Supplemental Security Income. Instead, the Federal Government provides supplemental income assistance to covered residents of Puerto Rico through a different benefits program— one that is funded in part by the Federal Government and in part by Puerto Rico. Notes following §§ 1381-1385.</p>
<p>The dispute in this case concerns a claim for Supplemental Security Income benefits by a resident of Puerto Rico named Jose Luis Vaello Madero. In 2013, Vaello Madero moved from New York to Puerto Rico. While he lived in New York, Vaello Madero received Supplemental Security Income benefits. After moving to Puerto Rico, Vaello Madero no longer was eligible for Supplemental Security Income benefits. Yet for several years, the U. S. Government remained unaware of Vaello Madero's new residence and continued to pay him benefits. The overpayment totaled more than $28,000.</p>
